**_[!] weBLeech is still a work in progress.. wait for it [!]_**
- [x] create a guided run
-  make the guided run pretty
-  bring the spider to life
-  build a web based front-end

**weBLeech** is a web based (HTTP/S) leech, you can ask it to crawl a site and find all available resources for download and then you can ask it to
actually go and fetch it all wheter the resource requires login or not, it can also filter the download list by 'file type'.

[-] **weBLeech** was written as a tool for my personal need and while in some cases it is wide and general enough to manage multiple scenarios,
in many others it doesn't.


## Prerequisites

None for now

## Usage

* #### The `run.py` file
---
  * `python run.py` :: | **it's actually all you need to do, there is a nice guided run built in**

* #### The `spider.py` file
---
  * `python spider.py` :: | **never actually needs to run on it's own, it includes all the crawling and leeching functionality**
